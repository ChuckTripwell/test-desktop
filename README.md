- NOTE: using this image will slightly change how ostree and grub works, so there is no way to rebase back to bazzite. please backup your stuff.
- NOTE2: rebasing to this is NOT recommended. you have been warned.

[:+:] you did WHAT?!?! [:+:]

- What is this?
  ```
  bazzite-nvidia image but with an archlinux kernel optimized for gaming.
  ```

- Is it safe?
  ```
  probably not.
  ```

- Then, why?
  ```
  in theory: the speed of cachyos, the stability of bazzite.
  in practice: It's my device, I'll do what I want with it.
  ```

- Can you add this feature...?
  ```
  no.
  ```

- Can I create my own version?
  ```
  yes.
  all changes I made are in the Containerfile. go nuts.
  I will not provide ANY help. you are on your own.
  ```

- I found a bug!
  ```
  here's a cookie.
  ```

- I'm using this and experiencing no issues whatsoever, this is actually very smooth.
  ```
  cheers!
